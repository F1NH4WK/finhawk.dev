### Built With

I choosed those because they were the ones I have been using to practice website creation, so I was used to deal with them. By the way, the Vercel support for Next's pretty good.

### Where do I started?
 
 First I bought a domain in <a href = "https://domains.google"><b>Google Domains</b><a/> and then I set my DNS in <a href = "https://vercel.com"><b>Vercel</b></a> to it. It may take some time to DNS works, but you can check it in <a href = "https://dnschecker.org"><b>DNS checker</b>.</a> After doing these steps I started to setup the pallete and so on...
```md
The .dev was the cheaper and the one I was looking for, lol
```

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Setting up the colors

I have used <b><a href = "https://coolors.co">Coolors</a> and <a href = "https://huemint.com">Huemint</a></b> to define my color palette and test it out, respectively. <br />
